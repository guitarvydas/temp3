#+CAPTION: test0 invocation
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:load-system :temp3)
(aa::test0)
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: test0 result
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
consumed message "hello" on incoming pin :IN of "consumer"
NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE
** second test - (ql:quickload :temp3), (aa:test6)
   see test6.drawio
   second test fails: CL-USER 22 > (aa::test6)
   part "main schem" outputs /"test 6"/ on pin :MAIN-SCHEM-IN
   NIL
   the output pin should be :main-schem-out, not :main-schem-in

   The second test should send the message ("test 6") down from main-schem
   into child-schem, then through flow-through-1 and flow-through-2 back up
   to child-schem and then, finally out of main-schem (on pin :main-schem-out).

* Design Intention
** FYI - when an event arrives at a Code part (aka Leaf), it runs some code (usually a CASE on the pin name) to completion then returns.  When an event arrives at a Schematic, the "same" thing happens - the event is passed into the bowels of the schematic and is processed to completion by the graph of parts.
