* Status
** working on test0 and test6, usage - (ql:quickload :temp3), (aa:test6)
   see test6.drawio
   second test fails: CL-USER 22 > (aa::test6)
   part "main schem" outputs /"test 6"/ on pin :MAIN-SCHEM-IN
   NIL
   the output pin should be :main-schem-out, not :main-schem-in

   The second test should send the message ("test 6") down from main-schem
   into child-schem, then through flow-through-1 and flow-through-2 back up
   to child-schem and then, finally out of main-schem (on pin :main-schem-out).

** hope to overwrite cl-event-passing with this
* Design Intention
** FYI - when an event arrives at a Code part (aka Leaf), it runs some code (usually a CASE on the pin name) to completion then returns.  When an event arrives at a Schematic, the "same" thing happens - the event is passed into the bowels of the schematic and is processed to completion by the graph of parts.
** schematic input handler
   set self.busy true
   lookup the input pin in self.sources, then dispatch the event
   set self.busy false (the dispatcher will see self as busy recursively, if any of self's children are busy, this recurs until we hit code parts.  [nb. need to revamp busy to tak output and input queues into account in parts of lower-level schematics)
